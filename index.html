                <h2>Carlos Vasquez</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Carlos Vasquez. For the past year I have been working for a 
                    video streaming service company in the greater Seattle as both a
                    Regression Tester and an Embedded QA. To further improve my skills I decided to enroll in the 
                    UW Coding Bootcamp, where I'm studying Full-Stack Web Development.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Working alonside developrs made me really like and appreciate the work
                    that is put into the services that we commonly use as a source of entertainment.
                    I love the fact developers are constantly forced to learn how to use new technology.
                    It's what drove me into the world of coding. It's a constant source of entertainment while getting paid.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So far I have been more keen to Frontend Development than Backend.
                    I like interacting with different aesthetics for websites. I've alwasy enjoyed anything
                    that is visually stimulating.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My hobbies involve anything from Boxing to Painting. While I enjoy painting, nothing beats
                    a good old fashion pen. Working with black ink is my specialty. I can draw portraits for hours. 
                    My art style comes from years or watching anime and reading manga from the likes of Kentaro Miura's Berserk.
                    I think that I can apply my artistic tendencies into my learning and future work in the tech field. 
                </p>

            <p>
                This is a work in progress. I'm currently learning how to build web apps using HTML
                , CSS, and JavaScript. I have used APIS and Bootstrap, but I'm the most confident 
                with basic HTML and CSS at the moment. I will continue to add things in this section.

            <h1 class="headings">Regression Testing</h1>
            <p>
                Before a new build for an app is released, the regression team 
                has to follow different scenarios in which there are possibilities 
                of the app malfunctioning. My job is to scrutinize the app as 
                much as possible to expose any weaknesses the developers might have 
                overlooked. I deal with a multitude of devices that behave differently. 
                Any bug found must be filed and measured according to risk.

            <h1 class="headings">Quality Assurance</h1>
            <p>
                On the developers team, as a QA/QE (Quality Assurance Engineer), 
                I have to work alongside developers to deploy different version 
                of the app that the team is working on and check for bugs. I also 
                have to do the final check before a build is merged. If there are 
                mistakes in the code or function of the app, it is my job to let the 
                developers know so that they can address the issue. Communication is key!
